It is an interactive tool designed to demonstrate various pathfinding algorithms on a grid. The site allows users to visualize how different algorithms find the shortest path between a start and end point while navigating around obstacles. Key features include:<br/>

---Multiple Algorithms: Users can choose from a variety of algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS.<br/>
---Interactive Grid: Users can manually place start, end points, and obstacles on the grid, or generate random mazes.<br/>
---Real-Time Visualization: Each algorithm is animated, showing how nodes are explored and the shortest path is constructed.<br/>
---Algorithm Comparisons: This allows users to see the differences in how algorithms approach the pathfinding problem.<br/>
